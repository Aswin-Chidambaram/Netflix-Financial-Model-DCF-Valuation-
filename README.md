### 1. Executive Summary

This repository contains a comprehensive 3-statement financial model and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation for Netflix, Inc. The analysis was performed on **November 10, 2025**, using the most recent full-year financial data available at the time: **Netflix's Fiscal Year 2024 10-K report** (published Jan 27, 2025).

* **Intrinsic Value (Base Case):** **$510.68 per share**
* **Market Price (on 10-Nov-2025):** **$1123.95 per share**

### 6. Sensitivity Analysis & Final Conclusion

A sensitivity analysis confirms the "Sell" thesis. The market price of **$1123.95** is not just outside the base-case value; it is **80% higher than the most optimistic scenario** in this entire matrix ($624.73).

This demonstrates a significant and clear disconnect between the company's fundamental value and its current market price. The market is pricing in growth and risk assumptions that are not supported by a fundamental analysis of the company's own historical data.
